# payment-diversity

Payment Diversity (also referred to as Payments Diversity) is an overarching concept and guiding philosophy that stipulates the following:

* All individuals have different values and beliefs.
* Money and the transactions of value are intrinsically linked with these beliefs and preferred styles of living.
* Payment methods are inherently ideological.
* It is the right of every individual to choose their preferred method of payment and value transfer that aligns with their personal beliefs and lifestyle 
* Merchants shall not have to decide for their customers, which form of value they should use, as long as the end result for the merchant is the same.
* Given proper and fair conversions, merchants have no reason or right to dictate the payment method used by their customers (within reason).
